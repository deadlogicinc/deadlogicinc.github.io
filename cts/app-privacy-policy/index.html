    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Last updated: Jan 2, 2025</h2>
    
    <p>Deadlogic (“DeadLogic”, “the company”, “we” or “us”) built the CTS app (“the app”, “the Service”) for Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms as a free app. This Service is provided by DeadLogic at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    
    <p>This page is used to inform app users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>
    
    <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Email Address. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

    <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics/" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Location Data (Android-only)</h2>
    <p>The Android CTS app requires high-precision location access for BLE scans to work. This is a platform limitation—your location data is never used directly by CTS.</p>

    <p>Starting from Android 6.0, the Android operating system requires apps to be granted location access in order to scan for BLE devices. Starting from Android 10, this requirement became stricter—high-precision location access is now required for BLE scans. Android 12 and newer versions of Android let developers use a different set of Bluetooth permissions, but by omitting the location permission, some BLE beacons may not show up, so we have decided to keep location access as a required permission to use the app.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>In case of an error while using the Service, we may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your device, collectively known as Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics that may help us debug and investigate the error.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.</p>

    <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and to improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse these cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We employ the services of third-party companies and/or individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>

        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used so that we may improve on it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties do have access to your Personal Information in order to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purposes, subject to provisions listed in their own Privacy Policies.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
